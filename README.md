//Top 10 Websites
// We had to make our figmas before coding any of the HTML we first started with our menu then our pages and we used the same template we made for each of our top 10s website 
//the top 10s also have lots of information about our foods

//peer review : Lucas Guptill, sites design is nice and on theme with the lists and both lists are properly designed and themed to make you extreamly hungry, all video links work and interlinking between sites is flawless!

only weird thing to me is how both of your top10's have a footer at the bottom but your home page doesnt, you could tag in your emails in the footer so it also doesnt just act as a second nav bar but thats just a suggestion! amaing work you guys.
